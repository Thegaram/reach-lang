  Theorem formalization:
  (<=
   v3
   (- dlc_UInt_max 1))

  This could be violated if...
    "dlc_UInt_max" = 1
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:3:30:application)
      (because: builtin)
    "v3" = 1
      (from: v3)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:9:40:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."get"())

  In context...
    "v17" = (<= v6 v16 )
      (from: v17)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PLE(v6, v16 ))
    "v16" = (- dlc_UInt_max 1 )
      (from: v16)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating SUB(UInt.max, 1 ))
    "v6" = v3
      (from: v6)
      (bound at: ./overflow_con.rsh:12:7:dot)
      (because: an honest message from "A" of v3)
