  Theorem formalization:
  (<=
   v3
   (- dlc_UInt_max 1))

  This could be violated if...
    "dlc_UInt_max" = 1
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:3:30:application)
      (because: builtin)
    "v3" = 1
      (from: v3)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:9:40:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."get"())

  In context...
    "v15" = (<= v5 v14 )
      (from: v15)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PLE(v5, v14 ))
    "v14" = (- dlc_UInt_max 1 )
      (from: v14)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating SUB(UInt.max, 1 ))
    "v5" = v3
      (from: v5)
      (bound at: ./overflow.rsh:11:7:dot)
      (because: an honest message from "A" of v3)
