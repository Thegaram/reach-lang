  Theorem formalization:
  (=
   (+ v3 v4)
   (* v3 2))

  This could be violated if...
    "v3" = 0
      (from: v3)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:8:32:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."getX"())
    "v4" = 1
      (from: v4)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:9:32:application)
      (because: evaluating interact("A")."getX"())

  In context...
    "v10" = (= v9 v5 )
      (from: v10)
      (bound at: ./assert_more_expr.rsh:application)
      (because: evaluating PEQ(v9, v5 ))
